# 🌦️ BMSK Chatbot – Bihar Mausam Sewa Kendra

The **BMSK Chatbot (Bihar Mausam Sewa Kendra Chatbot)** is a web-based weather information chatbot developed during my internship under the **Planning and Development Department, Government of Bihar**.

The objective of this project was to provide an easy-to-use digital platform for accessing weather-related information collected from government-installed sensor infrastructure and delivered through APIs.

## 🧠 Project Overview

During my internship, I developed a chatbot for **Bihar Mausam Sewa Kendra** to assist users in obtaining weather-related information in a simple and interactive manner.

The chatbot is designed to work with real-time and near real-time weather data collected from field-installed sensor nodes such as **ARG** and **AWS**, which are widely used by government departments for environmental monitoring.

## 📡 Data Collection Using Sensor Nodes

Weather data used in the system is collected through government-operated sensor infrastructure:

### 🔹 ARG – Automatic Rain Gauge
- Measures real-time rainfall data
- Installed at various geographical locations across Bihar
- Automatically records precipitation without manual intervention

### 🔹 AWS – Automatic Weather Station
AWS sensor nodes collect multiple atmospheric parameters such as:
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Rainfall  
- Wind speed and direction  
- Atmospheric pressure  

These **ARG and AWS sensor nodes** continuously monitor environmental conditions and transmit the collected data to centralized servers maintained by the department.

## 🔗 API Integration

The collected sensor data is made available through **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces).

- APIs act as a bridge between the sensor data servers and the chatbot application
- The chatbot sends user queries (for example: weather conditions, rainfall status, temperature)
- The API fetches the relevant data from the server
- The chatbot processes the response and displays it in a user-friendly format

This approach ensures **accurate, fast, and automated weather information delivery**.
